<li>Task is solved using Visual Studio Code in Python 3.10.7</li>

<h3>Instructions to run the programing task code</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Be sure you have your Python IDE to interepret with Python 3.10.7 (it doesn't have to be Visual Studio Code)</li>
  <li>I always advice to use Python Virtual Environment on top of  core Python installation so, if any problems arise regarding to Python files, they easily can be  managed without touching original python installation. This said, run the command on cloned or unzipped project location  "py -m venv vEnv3_10_7"</li>
    <li>run "pip install -r requirements.txt" at project location, So, we don't need to look 1 by 1 what to install for missing libraries (Be sure your vEnv3_10_7 is acting as Python interpreter but not the core python installation</li>
  <li>To be continued</li>
